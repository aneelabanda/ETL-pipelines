# ETL-pipelines E Commerce & Retail
1. Understand the Project Requirements
Before creating the backlog, I would thoroughly understand the project requirements, including the objectives, scope, tools/technologies to be used, and deadlines. In this case, itâ€™s the creation of an ETL pipeline using Python, SQL, Apache Airflow, and targeting E-Commerce & Retail data.

2. Break Down the Project into Key Phases
I would divide the project into key phases to keep the workflow organized:

Project Setup: Setting up the infrastructure, repository, environment, and configurations.
Data Extraction: Collecting data from external sources (APIs, CSVs, etc.).
Data Transformation: Cleaning, normalizing, and preparing the data for loading.
Data Loading: Loading data into the target PostgreSQL database.
Automation & Scheduling: Automating the entire ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow.
Testing & Deployment: Validating the pipeline and deploying it.
