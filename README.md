# ETL-pipelines E Commerce & Retail
1. Understand the Project Requirements
Before creating the backlog, I would thoroughly understand the project requirements, including the objectives, scope, tools/technologies to be used, and deadlines. In this case, it’s the creation of an ETL pipeline using Python, SQL, Apache Airflow, and targeting E-Commerce & Retail data.

2. Break Down the Project into Key Phases
I would divide the project into key phases to keep the workflow organized:

Project Setup: Setting up the infrastructure, repository, environment, and configurations.
Data Extraction: Collecting data from external sources (APIs, CSVs, etc.).
Data Transformation: Cleaning, normalizing, and preparing the data for loading.
Data Loading: Loading data into the target PostgreSQL database.
Automation & Scheduling: Automating the entire ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow.
Testing & Deployment: Validating the pipeline and deploying it.


Here's a detailed example of how to structure the **README.md** for your **ETL Pipeline** project:

# E-Commerce & Retail ETL Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project implements an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline designed to handle **E-Commerce & Retail data**. The goal is to extract product sales and customer order data, transform it to a clean and standardized format, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline is fully automated using **Apache Airflow** and is designed for scalability and performance.

## Project Goals
- **Extract**: Gather product and order data from external sources (APIs or CSV files).
- **Transform**: Clean, validate, and standardize the data.
- **Load**: Insert the processed data into a PostgreSQL database.
- **Automate**: Schedule and automate the entire ETL pipeline using **Apache Airflow**.
- **Containerize**: Deploy the pipeline in a containerized environment using **Docker** for ease of deployment.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For scripting the extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)**: For storing and querying processed data.
- **Apache Airflow**: For automating and scheduling the ETL pipeline tasks.
- **Docker**: To containerize the ETL pipeline and ensure consistency across different environments.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

---

## ETL Process

1. **Extract**:  
   Data is extracted from external sources like APIs or CSV files. The product data and customer order data are retrieved using Python scripts and stored in raw data files.

2. **Transform**:  
   The raw data is cleaned and normalized. Missing values are handled, incorrect formats are fixed, and data is structured according to the requirements for loading into the database.

3. **Load**:  
   The transformed data is inserted into a PostgreSQL database. The database schema includes tables for products, customers, and orders, ensuring data relationships are maintained (e.g., foreign keys for orders linked to customers).

4. **Automation**:  
   The entire ETL pipeline is automated using **Apache Airflow**. Tasks for extraction, transformation, and loading are defined in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and the DAG is scheduled to run periodically (e.g., daily).

5. **Containerization**:  
   The pipeline and its dependencies are containerized using **Docker**. This ensures the pipeline runs in the same environment regardless of the system used for deployment.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **PostgreSQL** (for data storage)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerization)
- **Apache Airflow** (installed via Python)

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/ecommerce-etl-pipeline.git
cd ecommerce-etl-pipeline
```

#### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all necessary dependencies, including:
- `pandas` (for data manipulation)
- `psycopg2` (for PostgreSQL integration)
- `requests` (for data extraction via API)
- `apache-airflow` (for automating the pipeline)

#### 4. Set up PostgreSQL Database
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
2. Create a new database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_data;
```
3. Set up the tables:
```bash
psql -d ecommerce_data -f sql/schema.sql
```

#### 5. Configure Apache Airflow
1. Initialize the Airflow database:
```bash
airflow db init
```
2. Start the Airflow web server and scheduler:
```bash
airflow webserver -p 8080
airflow scheduler
```
3. Open the Airflow web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` and ensure the DAG is listed.

#### 6. Running the ETL Pipeline
- The ETL pipeline can now be run manually or automatically based on the defined schedule in Airflow. You can trigger the DAG via the Airflow web interface.

#### 7. Optional: Running with Docker (for containerized setup)
If you prefer a containerized environment, you can run the entire setup with Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker-compose build
```
2. Start the services (Airflow, PostgreSQL, etc.):
```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will automatically set up the ETL pipeline, PostgreSQL database, and Airflow in containers.

---

## Usage

Once everything is set up, the pipeline will:
1. Extract data from defined APIs or CSV files.
2. Transform the data (cleaning, normalization, etc.).
3. Load the data into PostgreSQL.
4. Repeat the ETL process based on the schedule set in Apache Airflow.

### Airflow Web Interface
You can monitor the status of the ETL pipeline in the Apache Airflow web interface at `http://localhost:8080`. Here, you can see the status of the DAG, task logs, and set up alerts for failure/success.
